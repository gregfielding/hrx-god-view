# Matrix-Style AI System - Specialized Agent Framework

## 🎯 Overview

We've successfully implemented a "Matrix-style" AI system where specialized agents (like Deal Coach) can "upload" their expertise and context to the main AI, creating a unified system where the main AI can tap into specialized knowledge when needed - similar to Neo learning kung fu in The Matrix.

## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### 1. **Base Agent Framework**
- **`functions/src/agents/baseAgent.ts`** - Abstract base class for all specialized agents
- Provides common functionality: context gathering, entity validation, prompt generation
- Standardized interface for agent communication

### 2. **Specialized Agents**
- **`functions/src/agents/dealCoachAgent.ts`** - Deal Coach agent with sales expertise
- Extends BaseAgent with domain-specific logic
- Comprehensive sales methodologies (SPIN, Challenger, MEDDIC, etc.)
- Enhanced context gathering for deals, companies, contacts, salespeople

### 3. **Agent Registry System**
- **`functions/src/agents/agentRegistry.ts`** - Manages all specialized agents
- Automatic agent detection based on message patterns
- Context sharing and enhancement protocols
- Entity ID extraction and validation

### 4. **Enhanced Main AI**
- **`functions/src/enhancedMainChat.ts`** - Main AI with agent integration
- Automatically detects when specialized context is needed
- Loads enhanced context from relevant agents
- Provides unified AI experience with specialized expertise

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Message Analysis
```
User: "What is the next step I should take for deal ABC123?"
↓
Agent Registry analyzes message patterns
↓
Detects Deal Coach agent is relevant
```

### Step 2: Context Loading
```
Deal Coach Agent loads comprehensive context:
- Deal data and stage
- Company information and industry
- Contact details and roles
- Salesperson performance data
- Recent activities and notes
- Email history and communications
- AI inferences and learning data
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Prompting
```
Main AI receives enhanced system prompt:
"You are a Deal Coach with comprehensive context...
DEAL CONTEXT: ABC123 (Qualification) - Acme Corp
Contacts: John Smith, Sarah Johnson
Salespeople: Mike Wilson
Recent Activity: 5 activities, 3 notes
SALES EXPERTISE: SPIN, Challenger, MEDDIC methodologies..."
```

### Step 4: Context-Aware Response
```
Main AI provides strategic advice based on:
- Deal stage and progression
- Company-specific insights
- Contact relationship dynamics
- Salesperson strengths
- Historical success patterns
- Industry best practices
```

## 📊 Current Implementation

### ✅ **Deal Coach Agent (Live)**
- **Domain**: Sales and deal management
- **Detection Patterns**: 20+ patterns for deal-related questions
- **Context**: Comprehensive deal, company, contact, salesperson data
- **Expertise**: SPIN, Challenger, Solution Selling, MEDDIC methodologies
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and active

### 🔄 **Framework Ready for Expansion**
- **Recruiting Agent**: Candidate management, interview coordination
- **Placement Agent**: Job order matching, assignment management
- **Client Management Agent**: Client relationships, requirements gathering
- **Compliance Agent**: Regulatory compliance, documentation

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Agent Detection**
```typescript
// Automatic detection of relevant agents
const enhancement = await agentRegistry.detectAndEnhance(message, tenantId, userId);
if (enhancement.enhanced) {
  // Use specialized agent context
  systemPrompt = enhancement.systemPrompt;
  enhancedMessage = enhancement.enhancedMessage;
}
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Context Sharing**
```typescript
// Agents provide rich context
const contextShare = await agent.loadAgentContext(entityId, tenantId, userId);
// Includes: entity data, related entities, activities, notes, AI inferences
```

### 3. **Enhanced System Prompts**
```typescript
// Domain-specific expertise in prompts
const systemPrompt = agent.generateSystemPrompt(enhancedContext);
// Includes: methodologies, best practices, stage-specific guidance
```

### 4. **Unified User Experience**
- Users get specialized advice from main chat
- No need to switch between different AI interfaces
- Seamless context-aware responses
- Maintains conversational tone with expert knowledge

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Deal-Related Questions (Enhanced):
```
User: "What is the next step I should take for deal ABC123?"
AI: [Enhanced response with deal context, company info, contacts, recent activity, and specific next steps based on SPIN/Challenger methodologies]

User: "How can I advance the Acme Corp deal?"
AI: [Enhanced response with strategic advice based on deal stage, company profile, and contact relationships]

User: "What's the strategy for moving deal XYZ forward?"
AI: [Enhanced response with tactical recommendations based on deal progress and salesperson strengths]
```

### General Questions (Standard):
```
User: "What are my top tasks for today?"
AI: [Standard response without specialized context]

User: "Can you help me with email templates?"
AI: [Standard response without specialized context]
```
