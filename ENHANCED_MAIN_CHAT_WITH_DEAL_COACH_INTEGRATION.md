# Enhanced Main Chat with Deal Coach Integration

## Overview

The main AI chat system has been enhanced to intelligently detect deal-related questions and automatically tap into the Deal Coach's comprehensive context system. This creates a unified AI experience where users can ask deal-specific questions from the main chat and receive the same level of detailed, context-aware advice that the Deal Coach provides.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Deal Detection**
The system automatically detects when a user's question is deal-related using comprehensive pattern matching:

**Direct Deal References:**
- `deal ABC123` - Direct deal ID references
- `deal ABC123 XYZ` - Multi-word deal identifiers
- `Acme Corp deal` - Deal name references

**Deal-Related Intent Patterns:**
- `next step.*deal` - Next step questions
- `advance.*deal` - Deal advancement
- `move.*deal.*forward` - Progress questions
- `deal.*stage` - Stage-specific questions
- `deal.*strategy` - Strategic advice
- `deal.*advice` - General deal guidance
- `deal.*coach` - Direct coach references
- `deal.*help` - Help requests
- `deal.*suggestion` - Suggestion requests
- `deal.*recommendation` - Recommendation requests
- `deal.*action` - Action-oriented questions
- `deal.*plan` - Planning questions
- `deal.*approach` - Approach questions
- `deal.*tactic` - Tactical questions
- `deal.*technique` - Technique questions

### 2. **Automatic Context Enhancement**
When a deal-related question is detected:

1. **Deal ID Extraction**: The system attempts to extract deal IDs from the message
2. **Deal Verification**: Verifies the deal exists in Firestore
3. **Enhanced Context Loading**: Loads comprehensive Deal Coach context including:
   - Company data (name, industry, notes, tone settings, AI inferences)
   - Location data (addresses, contact info, activity history)
   - Contact data (roles, communication preferences, notes, email activity)
   - Salesperson data (performance, preferences, strengths)
   - Deal-specific data (notes, emails, activities, tasks, learning insights)

### 3. **Enhanced System Prompts**
When deal context is available, the system generates enhanced system prompts that include:

```
You are an AI assistant embedded in a React + Firebase CRM with enhanced Deal Coach capabilities.

DEAL CONTEXT:
- Deal: [Deal Name] ([Stage])
- Company: [Company Name]

5. Reference relevant context when making suggestions
6. Maintain the conversational, helpful tone of the main chat
7. If the user asks about deals not in context, ask for clarification

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Provide a brief analysis of the current situation
- Suggest specific next steps and actions
- Reference relevant context when making recommendations
- Be specific about which contacts to engage and how

```

### 4. **Enhanced User Messages**
The user's original message is enhanced with deal context:

```
Original: "What is the next step I should take for deal ABC123?"

Enhanced: "What is the next step I should take for deal ABC123?

[Deal Context: Acme Corp Deal (Qualification) - Acme Corporation

```
