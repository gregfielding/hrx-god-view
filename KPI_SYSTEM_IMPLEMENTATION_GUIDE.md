# KPI System Implementation Guide

## Overview

The KPI (Key Performance Indicator) system provides comprehensive performance tracking and AI-powered task suggestions for sales teams. It includes KPI definition management, assignment to salespeople, progress tracking, activity logging, and intelligent task recommendations.

## Features

### 1. KPI Management
- **KPI Definitions**: Create and manage KPIs with categories, types, targets, and frequencies
- **Categories**: Activity, Revenue, Conversion, Engagement, Efficiency
- **Types**: Count, Percentage, Currency, Duration, Score
- **Frequencies**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly
- **AI Integration**: Enable/disable AI task suggestions per KPI

### 2. KPI Assignment
- Assign KPIs to individual salespeople
- Customize targets per salesperson
- Set start/end dates for assignments
- Track assignment status

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Visual progress indicators
- Status classification (On Track, Behind, Completed)
- Historical tracking by period

### 4. Activity Logging
- Log various activity types (calls, emails, meetings, etc.)
- Track activity value and duration
- Record outcomes (positive, neutral, negative)
- Link activities to contacts, companies, or deals

### 5. AI Task Suggestions
- Intelligent task recommendations based on KPI gaps
- Priority-based suggestions
- Task acceptance and completion tracking
- Contextual reasoning for suggestions

## Components

### 1. KPIManagement Component
**Location**: `src/components/KPIManagement.tsx`

**Purpose**: Admin interface for managing KPI definitions and assignments

**Features**:
- Create, edit, and delete KPI definitions
- Assign KPIs to salespeople
- View assignment status
- Enable/disable AI suggestions

**Usage**:
```tsx
<KPIManagement tenantId={tenantId} />
```

### 2. KPIDashboard Component
**Location**: `src/components/KPIDashboard.tsx`

**Purpose**: Salesperson interface for viewing KPIs and logging activities

**Features**:
- View assigned KPIs and progress
- Log activities
- View AI task suggestions
- Track recent activities

**Usage**:
```tsx
<KPIDashboard tenantId={tenantId} salespersonId={salespersonId} />
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add to CRM Settings
Add the KPI Management component to your CRM settings tab:

```tsx
// In your CRM settings component
import KPIManagement from '../components/KPIManagement';

// Add to settings tabs
{tabValue === 6 && (
  <KPIManagement tenantId={tenantId} />
)}
```

### 2. Add to Salesperson Dashboard
Add the KPI Dashboard to salesperson views:

```tsx
// In salesperson dashboard
import KPIDashboard from '../components/KPIDashboard';

// Add to dashboard
<KPIDashboard tenantId={tenantId} salespersonId={currentUserId} />
```

### 3. Firestore Security Rules
Add security rules for KPI collections:

```javascript
// KPI Definitions
match /tenants/{tenantId}/kpi_definitions/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.tenantId == tenantId || 
     request.auth.token.role == 'admin');
}

// KPI Assignments
match /tenants/{tenantId}/kpi_assignments/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.tenantId == tenantId || 
     request.auth.token.role == 'admin');
}

// KPI Tracking
match /tenants/{tenantId}/kpi_tracking/{docId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.salespersonId == request.auth.uid || 
     request.auth.token.role == 'admin');
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.salespersonId == request.auth.uid;
}

// KPI Activities
match /tenants/{tenantId}/kpi_activities/{docId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.salespersonId == request.auth.uid || 
     request.auth.token.role == 'admin');
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.salespersonId == request.auth.uid;
}

// KPI Task Suggestions
match /tenants/{tenantId}/kpi_task_suggestions/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.salespersonId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a KPI
```typescript
// Example: Daily Sales Calls KPI
const dailyCallsKPI = {
  name: "Daily Sales Calls",
  description: "Number of sales calls made per day",
  category: "activity",
  type: "count",
  target: 30,
  unit: "calls",
  frequency: "daily",
  priority: "high",
  tags: ["outbound", "prospecting"],
  aiSuggestions: true
};
```

### 2. Assigning a KPI
```typescript
// Assign KPI to salesperson
const assignment = {
  kpiId: "daily-calls-kpi-id",
  salespersonId: "salesperson-user-id",
  target: 25, // Custom target for this salesperson
  startDate: "2024-01-01",
  notes: "Focus on quality over quantity"
};
```

### 3. Logging Activity
```typescript
// Log a sales call
const activity = {
  kpiId: "daily-calls-kpi-id",
  activityType: "call",
  description: "Called John Doe at ABC Corp",
  value: 1,
  duration: 15,
  outcome: "positive",
  notes: "Discussed pricing proposal",
  relatedTo: {
    type: "contact",
    id: "contact-id",
    name: "John Doe"
  }
};
```

## AI Task Suggestions

### How It Works
1. **Gap Analysis**: AI analyzes KPI gaps and identifies areas needing attention
2. **Context Awareness**: Considers salesperson's current activities and performance
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests specific tasks with estimated impact
4. **Learning**: Improves suggestions based on task completion and outcomes

### Example Suggestions
```typescript
// AI-generated task suggestion
const suggestion = {
  title: "Follow up with ABC Corp",
  description: "Call John Doe to discuss pricing proposal",
  type: "call",
  priority: "high",
  estimatedValue: 1,
  reason: "You're 5 calls behind your daily target. This contact showed interest in your last call.",
  relatedTo: {
    type: "contact",
    id: "contact-id",
    name: "John Doe"
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. KPI Design
- **SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Balanced Metrics**: Mix of activity, outcome, and efficiency KPIs
- **Realistic Targets**: Base targets on historical data and team capacity
- **Clear Definitions**: Ensure everyone understands what counts toward each KPI

### 2. Implementation
- **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 key KPIs per salesperson
- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly check-ins on KPI progress
- **Feedback Loop**: Adjust targets and definitions based on results
- **Training**: Ensure salespeople understand how to log activities

### 3. AI Integration
- **Enable Gradually**: Start with AI suggestions for high-priority KPIs
- **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track which suggestions lead to KPI improvements
- **Refine Prompts**: Adjust AI reasoning based on sales team feedback
- **Combine with Human Judgment**: Use AI as a guide, not a replacement
