## Firestore Document Structure

The user document in Firestore will now include these fields:

```javascript
{
  // ... existing user fields ...
  
  // New preference fields
  remoteWorkPreferences: ["Fully Remote", "Hybrid (2-3 days remote)"],
  communicationPreferences: ["Email", "Slack/Teams", "Video calls"],
  workEnvironmentPreferences: ["Collaborative team environment", "Technology-forward"],
  preferredLearningMethods: ["Hands-on training", "Online courses"],
  industryPreferences: ["Technology", "Healthcare"],
  
  // ... rest of user fields ...
}
```

## Mobile App Implementation Notes

### 1. Data Retrieval
```javascript
// Example: Get user preferences
const userDoc = await firebase.firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).get();
const userData = userDoc.data();

const remoteWorkPrefs = userData.remoteWorkPreferences || [];
const communicationPrefs = userData.communicationPreferences || [];
// ... etc
```

### 2. Data Updates
```javascript
// Example: Update user preferences
await firebase.firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).update({
  remoteWorkPreferences: ["Fully Remote", "Hybrid (1-2 days remote)"],
  communicationPreferences: ["Email", "Slack/Teams"]
});
```

### 3. UI Components
- Use multi-select components with chips/tags for display
- Implement autocomplete with predefined options
- Allow custom entries beyond predefined options
- Provide delete functionality for individual preferences

### 4. Job Matching Logic
```javascript
// Example: Match user preferences with job requirements
function calculatePreferenceMatch(userPrefs, jobReqs) {
  const remoteWorkMatch = userPrefs.remoteWorkPreferences.includes(jobReqs.workType);
  const industryMatch = userPrefs.industryPreferences.includes(jobReqs.industry);
  const communicationMatch = userPrefs.communicationPreferences.some(pref => 
    jobReqs.communicationMethods.includes(pref)
  );
  
  return {
    remoteWorkMatch,
    industryMatch,
    communicationMatch,
    overallScore: (remoteWorkMatch + industryMatch + communicationMatch) / 3
  };
}
```

## Benefits for Mobile App

1. **Better Job Matching:** More accurate job recommendations based on user preferences
2. **Improved Engagement:** Personalized content and communication based on preferences
3. **Cultural Fit:** Better team placement and company culture matching
4. **Professional Development:** Targeted learning and growth opportunities
5. **User Experience:** More relevant and personalized app experience

## Migration Notes

- All new fields default to empty arrays (`[]`)
- Existing users will have these fields as `undefined` initially
- Mobile app should handle both `undefined` and empty array cases
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with users who have no preferences set (empty arrays)
2. Test with users who have multiple preferences in each category
3. Test job matching algorithms with various preference combinations
4. Test UI components with long preference names
5. Test data persistence and synchronization
