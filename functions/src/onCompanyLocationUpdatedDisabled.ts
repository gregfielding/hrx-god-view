/**
 * DISABLED: onCompanyLocationUpdated (Firestore Trigger)
 * 
 * This function is permanently disabled to prevent excessive invocations
 * that were causing performance issues and unnecessary costs.
 * 
 * The function was running on EVERY company location document update, causing:
 * - Excessive function invocations (20+ per hour during spikes)
 * - Cascading updates from pipeline total calculations
 * - Performance degradation during batch operations
 * - Unnecessary resource usage
 * 
 * Instead, we now use:
 * - updateCompanyLocationMirrorCallable: Only runs when explicitly called
 * - batchUpdateCompanyLocationMirrorsCallable: Efficient bulk processing
 * - No automatic Firestore triggers for location mirror updates
 * - Manual triggers only when location data actually changes
