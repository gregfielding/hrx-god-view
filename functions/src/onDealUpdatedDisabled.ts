/**
 * DISABLED: onDealUpdated (Firestore Trigger)
 * 
 * This function is permanently disabled to prevent excessive invocations
 * that were causing performance issues and unnecessary costs.
 * 
 * The function was running on EVERY deal document update, causing:
 * - Excessive function invocations (20+ per hour during spikes)
 * - Cascading updates to location documents (triggering onCompanyLocationUpdated)
 * - Performance degradation during batch operations
 * - Unnecessary resource usage and costs
 * 
 * Instead, we now use:
 * - updateCompanyPipelineTotalsCallable: Only runs when explicitly called
 * - batchUpdateCompanyPipelineTotalsCallable: Efficient bulk processing
 * - No automatic Firestore triggers for pipeline updates
 * - Manual triggers only when deal data actually changes
