 * COMPLETELY DISABLED: firestoreLogAILogCreated
 * 
 * This function is permanently disabled to prevent infinite feedback loops
 * that were causing runaway costs and excessive function invocations.
 * 
 * The function was creating meta-logs for every AI log creation, which then
 * triggered more AI log creation, creating an infinite loop.
 * 
 * Instead, we now use:
 * 1. Intelligent filtering in the logAIAction function
 * 2. Rate limiting and sampling
 * 3. Whitelist approach for event types
 * 4. No meta-logging of AI log operations
