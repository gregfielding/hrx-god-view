 * DISABLED: syncApolloHeadquartersLocation (Firestore Trigger)
 * 
 * This function is permanently disabled to prevent excessive invocations
 * that were causing performance issues and unnecessary costs.
 * 
 * The function was running on EVERY company document update, not just
 * when Apollo data was added, causing:
 * - Excessive function invocations (100+ per hour)
 * - Unnecessary resource usage
 * - Performance degradation
 * 
 * Instead, we now use:
 * - syncApolloHeadquartersLocationCallable: Only runs when explicitly called
 * - Manual triggers from the frontend when "AI Enhance" is clicked
 * - No automatic Firestore triggers for location syncing
