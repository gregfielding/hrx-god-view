/**
 * DISABLED: firestoreCompanySnapshotFanout (Firestore Trigger)
 * 
 * This function is permanently disabled to prevent excessive invocations
 * that were causing performance issues and unnecessary costs.
 * 
 * The function was running on EVERY company document update, causing:
 * - Excessive function invocations (20+ per hour at peak times)
 * - Unnecessary deal association updates
 * - Performance degradation from batch operations
 * - Cascading updates across the system
 * 
 * Instead, we now use:
 * - companySnapshotFanoutCallable: Only runs when explicitly called
 * - batchCompanySnapshotFanoutCallable: Efficient bulk processing
 * - Manual triggers from the frontend when needed
 * - No automatic Firestore triggers for snapshot fanout
