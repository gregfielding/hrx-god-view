- **`dealCoachAnalyzeCallable`** - `maxInstances: 2`
- **`findDecisionMakers`** - `maxInstances: 10`
- **`getUsersByTenant`** - `maxInstances: 5`

### 4. Cache Implementation Details

#### Server-Side Caching Strategy
- **In-memory caching** - Using `Map<string, { data: any; timestamp: number }>`
- **TTL-based expiration** - Automatic cache invalidation based on duration
- **Parameter-based cache keys** - Unique keys for different request parameters
- **Cache-first logic** - Serve from cache before any database/API calls

#### Cache Duration Strategy
- **High-frequency functions**: 10-30 minutes (calendar, salespeople)
- **AI functions**: 15-60 minutes (task suggestions, deal coach, decision makers)
- **User data**: 10 minutes (users by tenant)
- **Company research**: 60 minutes (decision makers - longer since data is stable)

### 5. Expected Impact Analysis

#### Cache Hit Rate Improvements
- **Calendar functions**: 90%+ cache hit rate expected
- **Salespeople function**: 85%+ cache hit rate expected  
- **Deal Coach function**: 80%+ cache hit rate expected
- **AI Task Suggestions**: 75%+ cache hit rate expected
- **Decision Makers**: 90%+ cache hit rate expected (long cache duration)
- **Users by Tenant**: 80%+ cache hit rate expected

#### Cost Reduction Estimates
- **Function invocations**: Additional 30-40% reduction
- **Database reads**: Additional 35-45% reduction
- **API calls**: Additional 40-50% reduction
- **External API calls**: Additional 50-60% reduction (SERP API, etc.)

### 6. Optimization Strategy Summary

#### Tier 1: High-Frequency Functions (0.04+ req/sec)
- **Extended caching** - Longer TTL for frequently accessed data
- **Aggressive cache keys** - Parameter-based caching for unique requests
- **Cache-first logic** - Serve from cache before any database/API calls
- **MaxInstances limits** - Prevent concurrent overload

#### Tier 2: AI Functions (0.03+ req/sec)
- **Already optimized** - Heavy sampling and filtering in place
- **Temporarily disabled** - Critical functions disabled for cost containment
- **Selective processing** - Only process high-urgency events
- **New caching** - Added caching for AI task suggestions

#### Tier 3: Low-Frequency Functions (<0.03 req/sec)
- **Standard caching** - 10-30 minute TTL based on data volatility
- **Monitoring** - Track for any unexpected spikes
- **Proactive optimization** - Added caching to prevent future spikes

### 7. Risk Mitigation

#### Data Freshness
- **Cache invalidation** - Manual cache clearing available
- **TTL-based expiration** - Automatic cache refresh
- **User-triggered refresh** - Force refresh when needed
- **Parameter-based keys** - Different cache entries for different parameters

#### Performance
- **Cache size limits** - Prevent memory issues
- **Cleanup functions** - Regular cache maintenance
- **Fallback logic** - Direct database access if cache fails
- **MaxInstances limits** - Prevent function overload

#### Functionality
- **Backward compatibility** - All changes are non-breaking
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation on cache misses
- **Monitoring** - Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Cache logging** - Track cache hits/misses for optimization
