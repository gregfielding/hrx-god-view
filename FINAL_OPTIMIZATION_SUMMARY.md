- **TTL-based expiration** - Automatic cache invalidation based on duration
- **Parameter-based cache keys** - Unique keys for different request parameters
- **Cache-first logic** - Serve from cache before any database/API calls

#### Cache Duration Strategy
- **High-frequency functions**: 10-30 minutes (calendar, salespeople)
- **AI functions**: 15-60 minutes (task suggestions, deal coach, decision makers)
- **User data**: 10 minutes (users by tenant)
- **Integration data**: 5 minutes (integration statuses)
- **AI logs**: 1 minute (frequent queries)
- **Company research**: 60 minutes (decision makers - longer since data is stable)
