# HRX Modules Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented four interrelated but standalone HRX modules that enhance workforce retention, satisfaction, and professional development. These modules are designed to work both independently and synergistically within the HRX Companion ecosystem.

## üéØ Module 1: Reset Mode

### Purpose
To provide a mental/emotional break mechanism for workers who are feeling overwhelmed, discouraged, or burned out ‚Äî without triggering formal escalation.

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

#### Core Functions
- **`activateResetMode`** - Manual, AI-detected, or manager-suggested activation
- **`deactivateResetMode`** - Manual deactivation with reason tracking
- **`submitResetModeCheckIn`** - Daily wellness check-ins during reset mode
- **`getResetModeDashboard`** - HR/Admin view with aggregate data
- **`detectResetModeTrigger`** - AI-powered trigger detection
- **`checkResetModeExpiration`** - Scheduled function for automatic expiration

#### Key Features
1. **Reset Trigger Options**
   - Manual (user-initiated): "I need a reset."
   - AI-detected: Based on tone/emotion in chats, low engagement, burnout risk scores
   - Manager/Admin suggested: Option to send a reset prompt

2. **Reset Mode Behavior**
   - Companion pauses deep prompts for 1‚Äì3 days
   - Sends gentle encouragement or check-ins only
   - Option to enable ambient mindfulness features
   - Suggests Mindfulness module if not already active

3. **Reset Dashboard (HR/Admin View)**
   - Track who has recently entered reset mode (aggregated/private unless opt-in sharing)
   - Suggest additional support if patterns persist

#### Data Architecture
- **Collections**: `resetMode`, `resetModeTriggers`, `resetModeCheckIns`
- **Key Fields**: triggerType, severity, aiConfidence, toneAnalysis, engagementMetrics, burnoutRiskScore
- **Privacy**: Only HR/Admins see aggregate reset data unless explicit permission granted

#### AI Logic
- Tone analysis: triggers soft prompt if distress/emotion detected
- Cool-down threshold: If 3+ resets occur in a short period, suggest direct HR outreach
- Pattern detection for systemic issues
